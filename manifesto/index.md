Finally, we have a mountain of data. Tons of it. Great.   
AI churns out terabytes of content. Wow.   
Everything sorted into endless tabs. Amazing.   
Endless facts at our fingertips. Incredible!   
Every piece of data screams for attention.

Fantastic. Marvelous. Hooray.

But wait. What’s the point?   
Where’s the value?   
And, ultimately, where’s the profit?

Seems, we've lost sight of what matters.   
The essential buried in noise.   
Time to separate wheat from chaff.

<ins>Let Digital Rareism Wear the Crown.</ins>

Switch off the noise. Carve out the signal.   
Send the decorator on holiday.   
Hand the canvas to the sculptor.   
It’s time for a purge.

Any data that doesn’t drive decisions gets the boot.   
Let sense breathe.   
Design retreats; deletion advances.   
Stop tolerating. Discriminate against the meaningless.   
Only the rare survives.

Every pixel that stays has earned its place.   
Every byte erased clears the way for truth.   
Deletion isn’t regret, it’s discipline.

In the age of excess, refusal becomes revolution.

Rarity endures.

**Painting noise.   
Shaping sense.**
