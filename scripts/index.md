Rare Scripts is a small collection of free, dependency-free JavaScript UI utilities used as part of the Rare Styles ecosystem.

These scripts are built to solve common interface tasks in a simple, predictable way. No frameworks, no build steps, no hidden magic. Just plain JavaScript you can read, understand, and adapt.

## Production Mode: ON

We actively use these scripts in production, in real projects, under real load. They are not demos or experiments, but practical building blocks that help us move faster. If they save time for other developers, especially beginners, that is exactly the point.

All scripts are released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/raredigits/rare-scripts/blob/main/LICENSE) and are free to use in personal and commercial projects.

Contributions, comments, and improvements are [welcome](https://github.com/raredigits/rare-scripts).

Minimalism with intent. Reuse encouraged.
