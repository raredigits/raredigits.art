The current trend of offering light/dark mode toggles and customizable interfaces tailored to individual user preferences is undeniable. It appears everywhere, from operating systems to text editors.

But this style system focuses on building **functional interfaces** designed for efficiency and clarity. Decorative flourishes and aesthetic customizations, while fashionable, fall outside the core mission.

### The Science Is Clear

Countless research studies<sup>1</sup> consistently demonstrate that dark text on light backgrounds offers superior readability for sustained reading and data comprehension. The science on this is about as controversial as gravity, it's not really up for debate among those who prioritize functional usability.

For this reason, the system intentionally doesn't support theme switching. This isn't an oversight, it's a deliberate design decision based on **prioritizing what actually works best** for users engaging with complex information.

### But What About My Brand Requirements?

If current brand guidelines mandate an inverted color palette (light text on dark backgrounds), custom stylesheets can be connected to override the default selectors. The system is designed to make this possible, though not encouraged.

### Professional Advice

Before implementing those overrides, consider having a friendly conversation with stakeholders to **clarify priorities**: are business effectiveness and user performance the primary goals, or are subjective aesthetic preferences taking precedence?

Sometimes the most valuable service a professional can provide is asking the right questions, even when they might ruffle a few decorative feathers.

Remember: Users rarely complain about interfaces that help them complete tasks quickly and accurately. They frequently complain about interfaces that prioritize looks over function, regardless of how "on brand" those looks might be.
