## Project Roadmap Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step checklist for launching a new project using the Rare Styles system. It covers the entire project lifecycle from initial concept to final delivery and ongoing maintenance.

<p class="note">Note: This is a living document following the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) concept. We're starting with the core framework and will expand each section over time with more detailed guides and resources. Links will be activated as content becomes available.</p>

### 1. Preparation: Understanding the Problem

The groundwork for success happens before a single line of code is written.

Start with the assumption that **the first articulation of the problem is incomplete or incorrect**. Your initial task is to discover what you're actually solving.

<div class="card full-width-caption padding-lg">
    <h5>Briefing Tasks:</h5> 
    <div class="columns">
        <li>Identify the key stakeholders and decision-makers. Kick off middlemen</li>
        <li>Identify the real users (often different from stakeholders)</li>
        <li>Conduct initial interviews to understand stated requirements</li>
        <li>Clarify business objectives beyond the stated requirements</li>
        <li>Establish success metrics that align with real objectives</li>
        <li>Document constraints: timeline, budget, technology restrictions</li>
    </div>
</div>

**Outcome:** A project brief that defines the actual problem to be solved, key constraints, and success metrics.

### 2. Research Phase

Before designing solutions, **understand the context** and develop a viable concept.

<div class="card full-width-caption padding-lg">
    <h5>Researh Tasks:</h5> 
    <div class="columns">
        <li>Research user needs and patterns through interviews/observation</li>
        <li>Identify the Core Value they needed</li>
        <li>Analyze existing solutions in the problem space</li>
        <li>Identify key user personas and their journeys</li>
        <li>Map content requirements and information architecture</li>
        <li>Develop initial wireframes or concept sketches</li>
        <li>Document data requirements</li>
        <li>Define the MVP scope that delivers core value</li>
        <li>Present concept to stakeholders for alignment</li>
    </div>
</div>

**Outcome:** A validated concept and MVP definition that stakeholders agree addresses the core problem.

### 3. Design Implementation

Translate concepts into concrete designs using Rare Styles principles.

<div class="card full-width-caption padding-lg">
    <h5>Design Tasks:</h5> 
    <div class="columns">
        <li>Sort and deliver Core Values to the interfaces</li>
        <li>Map user journeys between screens/pages</li>
        <li>Implement the grid system for layout structure</li>
        <li>Analyze existing solutions in the problem space</li>
        <li>Identify key user personas and their journeys</li>
        <li> content requirements and information architecture</li>
        <li>Develop initial wireframes or concept sketches</li>
        <li>Document data requirements</li>
        <li>Define the MVP scope that delivers core value</li>
        <li>Present concept to stakeholders for alignment</li>
    </div>
</div>

- [ ] 
- [ ] Apply typography hierarchy for clear information structure
- [ ] Develop the component system needed for your interfaces
- [ ] Create detailed mockups of key screens/pages
- [ ] Establish responsive behavior across device types
- [ ] Validate designs with stakeholders and potential users

**Outcome:** A complete design package ready for development implementation.

→ [Component system development](guides/project-launch/component-system/) (Coming soon)

## 4. Production Phase

Transform designs into functioning code and infrastructure.

- [ ] Set up development environment and version control
- [ ] Establish project structure and file organization
- [ ] Implement the Rare Styles foundation
- [ ] Develop custom components as needed
- [ ] Connect to data sources and APIs
- [ ] Implement responsive behaviors
- [ ] Conduct iterative testing and bug fixes
- [ ] Perform optimization for performance
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment for review
- [ ] Conduct final QA and accessibility testing
- [ ] Deploy to production environment

**Outcome:** A functioning product that meets the defined requirements.

→ [Rare Styles implementation guide](guides/project-launch/styles-implementation/) (Coming soon)  
→ [Testing methodology](guides/project-launch/testing/) (Coming soon)

## 5. Project Completion

Ensure a smooth transition from development to ongoing operation.

- [ ] Conduct project retrospective to document lessons learned
- [ ] Revisit original objectives and measure outcomes
- [ ] Identify opportunities for future iterations
- [ ] Document the system for maintenance teams
- [ ] Create user documentation if needed
- [ ] Establish monitoring and support protocols
- [ ] Transition to maintenance mode or next development phase
- [ ] Celebrate the team's achievements

**Outcome:** A successfully delivered project with clear path for future development.

→ [Documentation standards](guides/project-launch/documentation/) (Coming soon)

## The Iterative Process

Remember that this roadmap represents an ideal linear progression, but real projects rarely follow a perfectly sequential path. Expect to cycle back through earlier phases as you learn more about the problem and solution space.

The strength of the Rare Styles system is that it provides a solid foundation that can adapt to changing requirements without requiring a complete rebuild. Use this flexibility to your advantage as your project evolves.

We'll continue to expand this guide with more detailed resources for each phase of the project lifecycle. Check back regularly for updates, or [subscribe to our newsletter](https://rarestyles.com/newsletter/) for notifications when new guides are published.
